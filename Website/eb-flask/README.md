# WeatherStation Website
This is simple website that is using Flash (python) along with bokeh to plot and
illustrate the measurement.

## WIP
This was used to run python2 to EC2 way back and need to be updated accordingly

## Installation Guide
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```

## Run (I have deployed it as EC2 way back)
```bash
$ python application.py
```
